# Detecting Sarcasm in News Headlines
The analysis uses Recurrent Neural Networks , LSTM and NLP techniques in Python to identify a given news headline as sarcastic or otherwise. 

## **Recommended platform to run the code file**

It is recommended to run the IPYNB file on **Google Colab**, as it comes with an in-built GPU. Also I found it super helpful to secure data files this way. If the IPYNB takes a longer time to run on Google colab please see if the GPU has been invoked, as it needs to be set manually (Go to Edit -> Notebook Settings . Then select GPU) 

## **Required Packages**
1. pandas 
2. tensorflow 
3. keras
4. re
5. nltk
6. sklearn
7. random
8. google-colab

## **Storing the data files and reading the files**

The data file has been stored in google drive. The same file has been invoked in the code ( under the sections **'Google drive mount'** and **'Data read-in'**). This is a great way to secure our data files.
